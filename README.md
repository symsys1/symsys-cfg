# Context Free Grammar Gallery

See this repo running at: https://symsys1.jennylihan.repl.co

This is a website that takes context-free grammars that students have built using this [Nearley Parser Playground](https://omrelli.ug/nearley-playground/) and uses the [nearley npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nearley) to generate sentences from each grammar as well as Web Speech API for text-to-speech fun.

I built this as a gallery of student work for [this assignment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ld3np4gpDrVmVDXXdS4xg0Z5-_5ICO3Rig-dVE5M-z4/edit?usp=sharing) that I also wrote for symsys1!

## To use

1. On terminal, 
```
npm i
npm start
```
You may also want to host repo on free online IDE such as replit or glitch instead. 

2. Add more files to `grammars` folder, then update `index.html` with grammar name.
